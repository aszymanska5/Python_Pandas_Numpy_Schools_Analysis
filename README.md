# NYC Schools SAT Analysis

This project is part of a DataCamp course focused on data analysis with Python and Pandas.

It analyzes SAT performance data of New York City public schools to gain insights into their academic results.

## Key analyses performed:

- **Best Math Schools:** Identified schools with average math scores at least 80% of the maximum possible score (â‰¥ 640 out of 800), sorted from highest to lowest.

- **Top 10 Schools Overall:** Calculated total SAT scores by summing average math, reading, and writing scores, and listed the top 10 schools based on this combined score.

- **Borough with Largest SAT Score Variation:** Found the NYC borough with the highest standard deviation in total SAT scores, along with the number of schools in that borough, the average SAT score, and the standard deviation, all rounded to two decimal places.

## Technologies used:

- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

## Dataset:

The dataset contains columns such as `school_name`, `borough`, `average_math`, `average_reading`, `average_writing`, and other related SAT performance metrics for NYC public schools.
